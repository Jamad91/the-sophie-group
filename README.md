To get it up and running:
1) git clone
2) npm install
3) npm run dev

In two separate terminals. The vanilla `npm start` is for production â€” you won't use it in development!


## I need node >= 6.7.0

If you don't have it, I'll complain and tell you how to install it.


## My anatomy

`/app` has the React/Redux setup. `main.jsx` is the entry point.

`/db` has the Sequelize models and database setup.

`/server` has the Express server and routes. `start.js` is the entry point.

`/bin` has scripts. (Right now it has *one* script that creates a useful symlink.)

## Conventions

I use `require` and `module.exports` in `.js` files.

I use `import` and `export` in `.jsx` files, unless `require` makes for cleaner code.
